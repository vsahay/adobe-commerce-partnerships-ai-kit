## Create Order and Preview Order

Pass the `flexDiscountCodes` at the lineItems level in the `Create Order` and `Preview Order` requests.

| Endpoint                             | Method |
|--------------------------------------|--------|
| `/v3/customers/<customer-id>/orders` | POST   |

### Request Header

See [Headers](../references/api-headers.md) section.

### Request Body

```json

  "currencyCode": "USD",
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "extLineItemNumber": 1,
      "offerId": "80004567CA01A12",
      "quantity": 1,
      "currencyCode": "USD",

### HTTP Status Codes

The same as the standard [Get Order History API](../order-management/get-order.md).

## Preview renewal with flexible discount code

Eligibility for flexible discounts is validated in preview renewal for both auto-renewal and manual renewals.

### Preview automated renewal

The `POST /v3/customers/<customer-id>/orders` API with the `orderType` as `PREVIEW_RENEWAL` is used in the request to verify the eligibility of the order, including validation of customer eligibility for the flexible discount code that is currently applied on the subscription.

**Request**

```json
{
  "orderType": "PREVIEW_RENEWAL"
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
    "referenceOrderId": "",
    "orderType": "PREVIEW_RENEWAL",

            ]
        }
    ],
    "links": { // As existing response fields }
}
```

**Note:** If a subscription previously opted for a flexible discount or benefited from a reusable discount, but no longer meets the qualification criteria to receive the discount in the AutoRenewal, then the PreviewRenewal for AutoRenewal will show FAILURE for that flexible discount on the affected line item, as shown in the above example.

## Apply flexible discounts when placing manual renewal orders

You can apply a flexible discount to renewal orders, including late renewals, by specifying flexible discount codes at the line item level in the `Create Order` request. To do this, set `orderType` to `RENEWAL` and include `flexDiscountCodes` for the applicable line items.

| Endpoint                             | Method |
|--------------------------------------|--------|
| `/v3/customers/<customer-id>/orders` | POST   |

## Apply flexible discounts on subscriptions and Switch plan

- [Create Scheduled Subscription with flexible discount](#create-a-scheduled-subscription-with-flexible-discount)
- [Apply a switch plan with flexible discount](#apply-a-switch-plan-with-flexible-discount)
- [Update Subscription with a flexible discount code](#update-a-subscription-with-flexible-discount-code)
- [Remove a flexible discount from a subscription](#remove-a-flexible-discount-from-a-subscription)

### Create a scheduled subscription with flexible discount

You can use the `POST /v3/customers/<customer-id>/subscriptions` API with `flexDiscountCodes` in the request to create a subscription for a specific customer.

**Note:**

- Flexible discount codes are not validated while creating a subscription. Verification of customer eligibility occurs exclusively through the Preview Renewal API.
- A flexible discount code can be redeemed only once for a customer, thereby reducing the risk of unwanted code redemptions and thus preventing abuse.

### Update a subscription with flexible discount code

Use the `PATCH /v3/customers/<customer-id>/subscriptions/<subscription-id>` API with `flexDiscountCodes` in the request to update a subscription with the corresponding flexible discount.

**Note:**

- Flexible discount codes are not validated while updating a subscription. Verification of customer eligibility occurs exclusively through the Preview Renewal API.
- When a reusable flexible discount has already been used by a customer in an order contributing to a subscription, the discount is automatically applied when the subscription auto-renews. Customers are not required to explicitly opt in using Update Subscription for this automatic application. However, if a flexible discount is explicitly selected using Update Subscription, that discount takes priority and the reusable discount is not auto-applied.

#### Request

The `flexDiscountCodes` parameter indicates the flexible discounts applicable for the subscription.

```json
{
  "autoRenewal": {
    "enabled": true, // If Auto Renew is OFF, it must be turned ON to apply Discount Code. If it is already ON, this field is OPTIONAL.
    "flexDiscountCodes": ["ABCD-XV54-HG34-78YT"]
  }
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "8675309",
  "currentQuantity": 10,
  "usedQuantity": 2,
  "offerId": "65304470CA01012",
 
  "autoRenewal": {
    "enabled": true,
    "renewalQuantity": 5,
    "flexDiscountCodes": ["ABCD-XV54-HG34-78YT"]
  },
  "renewalDate": "2020-05-20",

  "deploymentId": "12345",
  "currencyCode": "USD",
  "status": "1000",
 
  "links": {
    "self": {}
  }
}
```

### Remove a flexible discount from a subscription

Use the `PATCH /v3/customers/<customer-id>/subscriptions/<subscription-id>` with the query parameter `reset-flex-discount-codes=true` to remove a flexible discount from a subscription.

#### Request

- **Request URL:** `PATCH /v3/customers/<customer-id>/subscriptions/<subscription-id>?reset-flex-discount-codes=true`
- **Request body:** Empty or applicable body for update subscription

Sample empty request body:

```json
{}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "8675309",
  "currentQuantity": 10,
  "usedQuantity": 2,
  "offerId": "65304470CA01012",
